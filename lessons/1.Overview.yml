      Your adjusted words per minute and key's accuracy are calculated based on accordance to given lines. So in theory you could type more than what you were asked for but why, you only spend your time and also it takes toll on total accuracy.

      After finishing text block you will be given excercise result so you could take into account your weak spots.
